1️⃣ Through Electron App Installed on Machine
How it Works:
Electron app runs locally on the user’s machine.
The app starts an Express server in the background.
REST API calls from browser or other apps can be routed to this server.
The app handles all types of printers automatically: USB, LAN/Wi-Fi, Bluetooth.
 
Steps:
Install Electron App on the machine (Windows/Mac/Linux).
Run App in Background on system startup (optional but recommended).
Add Printers to the system (via OS settings).
Express Server in Electron listens for REST API requests (e.g., /print).
Electron App Handles Printing using packages like:
pdf-to-printer (for Windows/Mac)
node-thermal-printer (for ESC/POS)
Send Print Commands automatically to the printer from Node.js inside Electron.
 
Pros
Works with all printer types (USB, LAN/Wi-Fi, Bluetooth).
No network dependency; works offline.
Handles automatic driver/configuration.
Fully controlled by local app → fast and reliable.
 
Cons
Must install the app on each machine.
Users need permissions to add printers locally.

2️⃣ Through Node + Express Server Hosted on Same Network (Wi-Fi/LAN)
How it Works
Node.js + Express server runs on a machine on the same network as printers.
Uses TCP/WebSocket connections to communicate with printers.
REST API calls are sent to this Node server, which then prints.
 
Requirements
Node.js installed on same host machine.
Printers connected on the same LAN/Wi-Fi as the server.
WebSocket/TCP socket connection to each printer.
Subnet scanning (if auto-discovering printers).
 
Steps
Start Node + Express server on host machine.
Scan LAN/Wi-Fi for available printers (port 9100 or via HTTP status endpoint).
Establish TCP/WebSocket connection for each printer.
Send ESC/POS or raw print commands over the socket.
Return print status via REST API.
 
Pros
No need to install app on every client machine.
Can centralize printing for all devices on the network.
 
Cons / Limitations
Must be on the same LAN/Wi-Fi. Printers on other networks are inaccessible.
Requires printer IP and port configuration.
Some printers may require authentication or special protocol.
Browser cannot access TCP directly → Node server acts as bridge.
 
 
✅ Recommendation:
If we want full automation and flexibility, go with Electron app installed locally.
If we want centralized network printing, go with Node + Express server on same Wi-Fi.
